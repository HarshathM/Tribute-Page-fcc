            <section id="tribute-info">Srinivasa Ramanujan was a great prodigy Indian mathematician. He was born on December 22, 1887. In spite of having received no formal education, this genius made unprecedented contributions to mathematical concepts such as mathematical analysis, infinite series, continued fractions, and number theory. Impressed by his innovative work, G.H. Hardy called him to Cambridge. Ramanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge during which he published many of his papers on mathematics. In 1916 he was awarded a Bachelor of Science Degree for his work on composite numbers. He was elected a Fellow of Royal Society in 1918. In 1919 he suffered from tuberculosis and vitamin deficiency and had to return to India. His poor health led to his early demise. The Indian Government honors this great genius by observing his birthday, December 22 as National Mathematics Day.</section>
